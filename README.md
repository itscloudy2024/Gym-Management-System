# Gym-Management-System
This C++ Gym Management System was developed during my freshman year at university as a comprehensive application to demonstrate mastery of C++ fundamentals. It features practical implementations of core programming concepts such as functions (including pass-by-reference), conditional statements, loops, arrays, switch-case, user input/output handling, and modular programming. The system allows users to register for gym subscriptions, choose personal trainers, add meal plans, calculate caloric needs and burns, generate weekly workout schedules, and manage payment processes. The code is thoroughly commented to explain the logic behind each section, making it both educational and functional. This project showcases my early journey in software development, and I hope it serves as a helpful reference for beginners learning C++.
